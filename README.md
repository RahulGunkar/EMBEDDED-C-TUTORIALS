# EMBEDDED-C-TUTORIALS
This repository aim to provide various code in the embedded c. Atmega 328p(Arduino) has been used as a target device.

 # Section 2 and Section 3 has been implemented on the online simulation platform named "TinkerCAD".
  And all the links for the same has been provided as well.
  
  I recommend everyone to finish the section 1 before moving to section 2 and section 3.
